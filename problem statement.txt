Write a program to implement Belman Gotd Algorithm:

1. run on the following data:

    # of nodes 5   s 1 2 3 4

  edges with weights -

      S->t = 6;  S->y = 7

     t->x = 5; t->y = 8; t->z = -5

     x->t = -2

    y->x = -3; y->z = 9

   z->x = 7; z->s = 2

2. Repeat the above exercise change y->x = -2;
